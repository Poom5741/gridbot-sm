# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature transforms the gridbot-sm smart contract project from a working prototype to a production-ready, secure, and fully tested system. The project involves comprehensive security auditing, test coverage enhancement (especially for deposit/withdraw flows), gas optimization, documentation improvements, and CI/CD pipeline establishment. The goal is to achieve enterprise-grade quality standards with automated verification gates to ensure all deposit and withdrawal functions have complete test coverage across success, failure, and edge cases.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Security Hardening

**User Story:** As a smart contract deployer, I want the contracts to be secure against common vulnerabilities, so that user funds are protected and the system can be trusted in production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Slither static analysis is run THEN the system SHALL have no critical or high severity issues
2. WHEN any deposit or withdrawal function is called THEN the system SHALL prevent reentrancy attacks through proper guards
3. WHEN ERC-20 token operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use SafeERC20 wrappers to handle non-standard token behaviors
4. WHEN access-controlled functions are called THEN the system SHALL enforce proper authorization using OpenZeppelin's access control patterns
5. WHEN mathematical operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use checked arithmetic or provide documented proofs for unchecked operations
6. WHEN handling USDT or other quirky tokens THEN the system SHALL explicitly handle fee-on-transfer tokens and non-boolean return values

### Requirement 2: Comprehensive Test Coverage with Deposit/Withdraw Gate

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated verification that every deposit and withdrawal function has complete test coverage, so that I can be confident all fund flows are properly tested.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system builds THEN it SHALL automatically discover all deposit/withdraw functions and generate a flow_targets.json file
2. WHEN tests are run THEN every function in flow_targets.json SHALL have success path tests
3. WHEN tests are run THEN every function in flow_targets.json SHALL have revert/access control tests
4. WHEN tests are run THEN every function in flow_targets.json SHALL have edge case tests
5. WHEN tests are run THEN every function in flow_targets.json SHALL have event emission tests
6. WHEN tests are run THEN every function in flow_targets.json SHALL have accounting verification tests
7. WHEN the coverage gate runs THEN it SHALL achieve ≥95% line coverage and ≥85% branch coverage for flow functions
8. WHEN the coverage gate runs THEN it SHALL fail CI if any required test patterns are missing

### Requirement 3: Mathematical Correctness and Distribution Logic

**User Story:** As a user depositing funds, I want mathematical guarantees that distributions are correct and deterministic, so that I can trust the fund splitting logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the contract is deployed THEN fixed split percentages SHALL sum to exactly 100%
2. WHEN funds are distributed THEN the sum of outputs SHALL equal inputs minus documented remainder policy
3. WHEN rounding occurs THEN the system SHALL follow a deterministic remainder policy
4. WHEN any distribution leg fails THEN the entire operation SHALL revert atomically
5. WHEN MLM configuration is updated THEN only the owner SHALL be able to make changes
6. WHEN distribution calculations are performed THEN they SHALL be tested with property-based and invariant tests

### Requirement 4: Gas Optimization and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user interacting with the contracts, I want gas costs to be optimized and monitored, so that transactions are cost-effective and regressions are prevented.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is built THEN it SHALL generate and commit gas snapshots
2. WHEN gas usage increases beyond threshold THEN CI SHALL fail to prevent regressions
3. WHEN low-risk optimizations are identified THEN they SHALL be applied without compromising security
4. WHEN gas reports are generated THEN they SHALL be uploaded as CI artifacts for review

### Requirement 5: Documentation and Developer Experience

**User Story:** As a developer or auditor, I want comprehensive documentation and smooth development experience, so that I can understand, deploy, and maintain the system effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any public/external function THEN it SHALL have complete NatSpec documentation
2. WHEN reading the README THEN it SHALL include threat model, remainder policy, admin controls, and deployment runbook
3. WHEN security issues arise THEN there SHALL be documented emergency procedures and admin powers
4. WHEN contributing to the project THEN there SHALL be clear guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md
5. WHEN running tests locally THEN `forge test` SHALL pass with one command
6. WHEN custom errors occur THEN they SHALL replace generic require statements with descriptive messages

### Requirement 6: Continuous Integration and Quality Gates

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines that enforce quality standards, so that code quality is maintained consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed THEN CI SHALL run build, tests, coverage, gas analysis, and static analysis
2. WHEN the flows-completeness-gate runs THEN it SHALL verify all deposit/withdraw functions have required test coverage
3. WHEN Slither analysis runs THEN it SHALL be configured to ignore library and script paths
4. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL be uploaded as artifacts
5. WHEN formatting or linting issues exist THEN CI SHALL fail until they are resolved
6. WHEN all quality gates pass THEN the system SHALL be ready for production deployment

### Requirement 7: Token Compatibility and Edge Case Handling

**User Story:** As a system integrator, I want the contracts to handle various ERC-20 token implementations correctly, so that the system works with different token standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with USDT THEN the system SHALL handle 6-decimal precision correctly
2. WHEN using fee-on-transfer tokens THEN the system SHALL either handle them correctly or explicitly reject them
3. WHEN tokens don't return boolean values THEN the system SHALL handle them through SafeERC20
4. WHEN allowance operations are needed THEN the system SHALL use safe increase/decrease patterns
5. WHEN testing token interactions THEN mock contracts SHALL simulate various token behaviors
6. WHEN edge cases occur THEN the system SHALL handle minimum/maximum bounds appropriately
