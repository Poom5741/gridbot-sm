- Set once during contract deployment
- Cannot be changed after deployment
- Stored as immutable state variables

### Dynamic Addresses

- Level1, Level2, Level3 MLM addresses
- Can be updated by contract owner
- Stored as mutable state variables
- Require non-zero address validation

## Configuration Requirements

### Environment Variables

### Validation Requirements

- All addresses must be valid Ethereum addresses
- All addresses must be non-zero
- Immutable addresses cannot be changed after deployment
- Dynamic addresses must be updated to non-zero addresses

## Security Considerations

### Address Security

- All wallet addresses should be carefully validated before deployment
- Consider using multi-signature wallets for large amounts
- Regular monitoring of wallet activity is recommended
- Immutable addresses should be stored securely

### Distribution Security

- All transfers are atomic - all succeed or all fail
- No partial distribution scenarios
- Comprehensive event logging for auditability
- Regular verification of distribution accuracy

## Best Practices

### Address Configuration

1. **Validation**: Always validate addresses before deployment
2. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all wallet addresses
3. **Security**: Use secure storage for address configurations
4. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for wallet activity

### Distribution Management

1. **Transparency**: Maintain transparency in all distributions
2. **Audit**: Regular audit of distribution calculations
3. **Documentation**: Keep detailed records of all distributions
4. **Compliance**: Ensure compliance with relevant regulations

This wallet distribution structure provides a balanced approach between project development needs, operational requirements, and MLM incentives while maintaining security and transparency.
